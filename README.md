# Re-Cvr Project

## Description

_Duration: 2 Weeks_

This project is designed to help the user recover quickly after a total home loss.  In the event of a home loss your insurance doesn't automatically payout your policy.  You're required to make a list of everything lost and if you're not specific enough you'll be reimbursed the lowest cost item your insurance can find.  There's a wide range of prices for a stainless steel fridge.

The app allows users to catalog individual high ticket items with model, make and an image.  It will also save your insurance information.  In the event of a loss a user can generate a report for their insurance with one click.
